First released on :
This is an open source data & code package for my recent paper "Theory of Vibrational Strong Coupling Induced Polariton Chemistry". See https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/65c02776e9ebbb4db9acbae9

The package includes: sample input files for HEOM real-time propagation and for IR spectra simulations, as well as the source codes for making all figures presented in the paper, in which parts of the original data are also included. 
Note that here we only provide the sample input files for simulating the VSC problem in the paper. We don't provide the HEOM source code for copyright reasons. The HEOM source code we used can be found at:

where you can find detailed instructions on compiling and running.
