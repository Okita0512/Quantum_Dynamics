First released on 01/29/2024:

This is an open source data & code package for my recent paper "Theory of Vibrational Strong Coupling Induced Polariton Chemistry". See https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/65c02776e9ebbb4db9acbae9

The package includes: sample input files for HEOM real-time propagation and for IR spectra simulations, as well as the source codes for making all figures presented in the paper, in which parts of the original data are also included. 
Note that here we only provide the sample input files for simulating the VSC problem in the paper. We don't provide the HEOM source code for copyright reasons. The HEOM source code we used can be found at:

https://github.com/hou-dao/OpenQuant

where you can find detailed instructions on compiling and running.

======================

Update on 05/02/2024: Some figures are updated according to the review comments. Note that the original file of the density matrix for plotting Fig. S2 is too big to be uploaded. Please contact me via wying3@ur.rochester.edu if needed (or you can obtain it by running HEOM simulations using the prepared input files). 

======================

Update on 06/28/2024: Glad that the paper has been accepted by Communications Materials, see https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-024-00551-y
